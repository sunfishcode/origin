This crate demonstrates the use of origin as a plain library API using
`#![no_std]` and `#![no_main]`.

This version uses `-nostartfiles` and origin is in control from the very
beginning. This uses origin in an "origin-start" configuration.

This crate depends on nightly Rust; for a version that works on stable
Rust, see the [origin-start-stable example].
