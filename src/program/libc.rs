//! Program startup and shutdown.
//!
//! To use origin's program startup enable the `take-charge` feature and define
//! a function named `origin_main` like this:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! /// This function is called by Origin.
//! ///
//! /// SAFETY: `argc`, `argv`, and `envp` describe incoming program
//! /// command-line arguments and environment variables.
//! #[no_mangle]
//! unsafe fn origin_main(argc: usize, argv: *mut *mut u8, envp: *mut *mut u8) -> i32 {
//!     todo!("Run the program and return the program exit status.")
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Origin will call this function after starting up the program and running
//! the constructors when `take-charge` is enabled. `argc` is the number of
//! command-line arguments with a value of at most `c_int::MAX`, and `argv` is
//! a pointer to a NULL-terminated array of pointers to NUL-terminated C
//! strings. `argc` and `argv` describe the command-line arguments. `envp` is a
//! pointer to a NULL-terminated array of pointers to NUL-terminated C strings
//! containing a key followed by `b'='` followed by a value. It describes the
//! environment variables. The function should return a value for the program
//! exit status.
//!
//! This is a low-level and somewhat C-flavored interface, which is in tension
//! with origin's goal of providing Rust-idiomatic interfaces, however it does
//! mean that origin can avoid doing any work that users might not need.
